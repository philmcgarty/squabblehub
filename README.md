# SquabbleHub

## Purpose

If you're a fellow geek, you've been in this situation before... You've heard someone say that "the book was better than the movie" or vice versa. You might have agreed or you might not but either way you had a valuable opinion to express in this endless debate... well now you can have that discussion as a community through the SquabbleHub App. A place where all geeks are welcome to squabble!
